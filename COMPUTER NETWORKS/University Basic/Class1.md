# Computer Networks

> When multiple computers are connected and communicate with each other — a series of nodes connected in a system where they can transmit, receive, and exchange data.

## Key Concepts

| Term                   | Definition                                                            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data**               | Continuous bit string or collection of bits                           |
| **Protocol**           | Rules and regulations for communication                               |
| **EMI**                | Electromagnetic interference                                          |
| **Bandwidth**          | The capacity of a channel                                             |
| **IP Address**         | A 32-bit long address required for networking devices                 |
| **Router**             | A device that determines the path for data from source to destination |
| **Connecting Devices** | Switch, Hub, etc.                                                     |
| **Transmission Media** | A medium used to transmit and receive data between devices            |

### IP Address Versions

- **IPv4** — 32 bits
- **IPv6** — 128 bits

## History

**ARPANET** was the first computer network.

## OSI Reference Model

The **International Standard Organization (ISO)** introduced a standard design for computer networks called the **Open System Interconnection Reference Model (OSI)**. It consists of **7 layers**, each required for computers to communicate and form a network.

| #   | Layer            | Description                                                                                                                        |
| --- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7   | **Application**  | Holds all software and algorithms                                                                                                  |
| 6   | **Presentation** | Handles the syntax and semantics of data                                                                                           |
| 5   | **Session**      | Maintains the session/connection from source to destination for each instance of communication                                     |
| 4   | **Transport**    | Supervises the entire process of data generation and transmission from source to destination                                       |
| 3   | **Network**      | Determines the path from source to destination                                                                                     |
| 2   | **Data Link**    | Creates an error-free link between two adjacent devices                                                                            |
| 1   | **Physical**     | All hardware specifications required to transmit, create, and receive data _(e.g., transmission media, router, network interface)_ |
